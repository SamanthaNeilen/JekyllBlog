What helps me stay focused when working from home is keeping the same schedule (and thus my habits around that schedule) and building the mental model of “working time” and “home time”. Just a disclaimer: I don’t have kids or pets that don't understand and will probably disrupt these habits and mental models.

For me this means:

- Waking up at 5-6 am to get an hour of study before I would regularly leave for work. 
- Instead of leaving for work simulate my commute by exercising for half an hour. Preferably a walk outside
- Have a fixed working space in the house to get in the mindset that being there is being "at work"
- Start working at your regular staring time 
- Keep the same eating, drinking and break habits you would have in the office (for my this is regulating my caffeine and not over caffeinating, have just my regular sandwich and apple for lunch at my desk followed by a half-hour exercise moment) 
- Don’t overeat or crash on the couch in front of the television during lunch to keep fit and motivated for the afternoon.
- Try not to do any chores during “work hours” to keep that in-office mindset
- Stop working at the same time you regularly leave for home (working long hours will probably make you less effective and burn you out in the long run)
- Go to bed a the same time as you would on a regular working day
