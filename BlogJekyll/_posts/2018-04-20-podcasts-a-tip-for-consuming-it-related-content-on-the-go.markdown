<p>
This month no technical article but a tip I want to share. For written content, I usually tend to focus on books and lose track of blogs. With podcasts, I can just listen on my commute or exercise walks. There is a lot of free and actively updated content out there and the podcasts can be listened to from your phone from the different podcast apps out there like <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for Android or <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/" target="_blank">Itunes</a> for Apple devices.
