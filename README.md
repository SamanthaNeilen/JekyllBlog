# JekyllBlog
This repository contains the files used to generate my blog on samanthaneilen.github.io

Though I use Visual Studio to manage this these files, they are not an actual website. <br/>
These files are a Jekyll project.The latest information on how to install and build a static website with Jekyll can be found at https://jekyllrb.com/. As an alternative view https://samanthaneilen.github.io/2017/11/18/starting-my-blog.html how this project is set up.
